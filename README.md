# UncertaintyML-course-ESSAI-labs
Lab material/code for the Uncertainty Quantification in Machine Learning Course @ ESSAI 2023, using Keras-Uncertainty and Pyro.

### Local setup

_These notebooks were designed and tested on Google Colab.
We **strongly** advise to use Colab to run them during the lectures as it will greatly speed up the setup process, since (almost) all of the required libraries are already pre-installed there.
We will not be available during the lectures for help concerning local setup._

If you want to run the code locally, you should install the following libraries:
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* tensorflow
* keras
* [keras_uncertainty](https://github.com/mvaldenegro/keras-uncertainty/)
* scikit-learn
* pandas
